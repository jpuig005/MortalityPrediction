Measuring and predicting patient health is the main issue in critical care research. One of the most important outcomes for admission in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is the risk of patients' mortality. Predicting this indicator could help practitioners to efficiently assess the severity of illness and effectively allocate resources for treatments and interventions.

This project aims to focus on predicting patients' death probability using different machine learning algorithms and compare their performance. To achieve this goal, we have chosen the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III). This publicly available database contains health-related information from over 50,000 patients, admitted to ICUs at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts.
